Overview
========

This project is a demonstration of BFS, DFS, and A* algorithms with custom graphs, to find shortest paths. It allows the user to specify the starting point of the search, the ending point of the search, any walls that cannot be bypassed, and the algorithm to search with.

When a search is started, the searching is visualized so the user can see which nodes have been searched, which nodes are currently being searched, and the shortest path found from start to finish.

Examples
========

When the program is first started, a blank map is created, with the start position in the upper left hand corner, and the finish position in the lower right hand corner.

Use the pickers at the bottom to pick the algorithm to search with, and to choose the current action to be performed when a cell on the map is clicked on (add/remove wall, change start position, change finish position).

Click the search button to start the search. Click the reset button to reset the graph.
